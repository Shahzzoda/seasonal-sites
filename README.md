# What to change <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6vj5quVNRhoQw/giphy.gif" align="right" width="100">

To choose theme, simply toggle `theme` variable in `themeConfig.js` file.<br/> 
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Make sure to set the value of `theme` exactly as specified ‚ö†Ô∏è 

Example code:

```javascript
const theme = "Christmas" || "New Year";
```

---

To add pictures and text, change the value of the `vars` in `NewYearPageData.js || ChristmasPageData.js` file. You'll find them in `./src/Data` directory. (For better understanding, read the comments above each `var`)

Example code:

```javascript
const imgTxt = [
  {
    image: `picture1.jpg`,
    text: `It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting...`,
  },
  {
    image: `picture2.png`,
    text: `It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting...`,
  },
];

const bannerData = {
  image: `banner.png`,
  text: `Hey you! Hope you have a great holiday season this year.`,
};

const farewellMsg = {
  image: `goodbye.png`,
  body: ` For your presence this year! Wishing your love, health, and
  happiness.`,
};
```
